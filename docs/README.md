## Configuration

### Step 1 -  Basic setup

Access in github to VTEX APPS and search react-app-template (https://github.com/vtex-apps/react-app-template) this is the template base for this project. If you want 
to start the project from the beginning clone this template.

Once in the repository directory, it is time to edit the `manifest.json` file. 

Once you are in the file, you must replace the `vendor` value. `vendor` is the account name you are working on, if you want yo can modify name, titel, and description. For example:

```json
{
  "vendor": "storecomponents",
  "name": "my-custom-component",
}
```
You should also check the `package.json` file globar and the file in react folder, verify the name and the version.

Then time has come to upload all the changes you made in your local files to the platform. For that, use the `vtex link` command. If the process runs without any  
errors, the following message will be displayed: `App linked successfully`.

To use the component in a store you should this in your "dependencies" in `manifest.json` file, "vendorName.componentName" : "version", for example:

```json
{
"dependencies": {
    "itgloberspartnercl.bullets-diagramation": "0.x"
  }
}
```
